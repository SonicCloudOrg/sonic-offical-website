## Frequently Asked Questions (Q&A)

Q1: Why does it still show as offline after the Agent is connected?

A1: You need to manually refresh the page or turn on [Auto Refresh] just after connecting. If you havenâ€™t connected all the time, you need to check the Agent log and check the filled Server IP and Agent Key.

Q2: Do you feel that the remote control device is stuck, or the packaging time is too long?

A2: For this problem, we can look at the following two points:
1. It is recommended that the Agent use a wired network environment instead of a wireless network.
2. Check whether the data cable connected to the device is intact. It is recommended to use a USB3.0 data cable or a data cable from an official hardware solution.

Q3: There will be sonic-android-supply or other plug-in security pop-up windows when starting on Mac?

A3: Mac: System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General, click Trust or Open anyway.
