# Application List

Here is a tutorial on how to use the application list.

## Get application list

When entering the [Application List] Tab page for the first time, the application list will be loaded once by default. Contains the following information:
1. Application Icon
2. Apply Chinese name
3. Application package name
4. Version number

You can directly **start** or **uninstall** the selected application.

## Install the app

### Drag and drop installation

Just drag and drop your App into the drag box to upload it to Sonic for installation.

### URL installation

Directly provide the download link of the apk or ipa file, download and install it directly on the device.

### Other ways

You can also go to [Panel] to use the remote adb function, and then execute adb install locally to install it.

## Frequently Asked Questions (Q&A)

Q1: The installation package for installing large files is very slow, and it takes a few minutes to complete the installation?

A1: For this problem, we can look at the following two points:
1. It is recommended that the Agent use a wired network environment instead of a wireless network.
2. Check whether the data cable connected to the device is intact. It is recommended to use a USB3.0 data cable or a data cable from an official hardware solution.
